#calculate Mahalanobis distance for a multivariate time series.
#-----------------------------------------------------------
#INPUTS 
#data          A data frame or matrix with one row for each time point.  
#               Note that the Mahalanobis distance calculation should be 
#               carried out on continuous data only, so if your data contain 
#               logical, factor or character data, proceed at your own 
#               risk...errors (or at least meaningless results) will probably ensue.
#fs            The sampling rate in Hz (data should be regularly sampled). 
#               If not specified it will be assumed to be 1 Hz.
#smoothDur     The length, in minutes, of the window to use for calculation 
#               of "comparison" values. If not specified or zero, there 
#               will be no smoothing (a distance will be calculated for each data observation).
#overlap       The amount of overlap, in minutes, between consecutive "comparison" 
#               windows. smooth_dur - overlap will give the time resolution of the 
#               resulting distance time series. If not specified or zero, 
#               there will be no overlap.  Overlap will also be set to zero if 
#               smoothDur is unspecified or zero.
#consec        Logical. If consec=TRUE, then the calculated distances are between
#               consecutive windows of duration smoothDur, sliding forward over 
#               the data set by a time step of (smoothDur-overlap) minutes.  
#               If TRUE, baselineStart and baselineEnd inputs will be used to define
#               the period used to calculate the data covariance matrix. Default is consec=FALSE.  
#cumSum        Logical.  If cum_sum=TRUE, then output will be the cumulative 
#               sum of the calculated distances, rather than the distances themselves. 
#               Default is cum_sum=FALSE.
#expStart      Start times (in seconds since start of the data set) of the experimental exposure period(s).  
#expEnd        End times (in seconds since start of the data set) of the experimental exposure period(s).
#                 
#baselineStart Start time (in seconds since start of the data set) of the baseline period 
#               (the mean data values for this period will be used as the 'control' to which all 
#               "comparison" data points (or windows) will be compared. if not specified, 
#               it will be assumed to be 0 (start of record).
#baselineEnd   End time (in seconds since start of the data set) of the baseline period.  
#               If not specified, the entire data set will be used (baseline_end will 
#               be the last sampled time-point in the data set).
#parallel       logical.  run in parallel?  NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.  would only help if I figured out how to do rollapply in parallel...
#       
#OUTPUT
#D             Data frame containing results
#D$t           Times, in seconds since start of dataset, at which Mahalanobis distances are 
#               reported. If a smoothDur was applied, then the reported times will be the 
#               start times of each "comparison" window.
#D$dist        Mahalanobis distances between the specified baseline period and 
#               the specified "comparison" periods
